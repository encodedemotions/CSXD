# LAB7 Database Security

• Create a MongoDB database which would contain some secured sensitive data (protected via 2-way encryption);

• Create an application which would display the data contained in the database (both common data and the decrypted sensitive data);

• Make sure that the sensitive data can only be accessed via your application (i.e. it is secure).
